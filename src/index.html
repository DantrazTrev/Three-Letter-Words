           <h3>Tur Oslo</h3>
           <br>
           It's a sad day in home, I've been talking about my trip to Oslo. But Mom & Dad don't think it was great. Amei is also giving me a look of disgust. I know things have been bad but this is my chance to make it all right, and I went to Oslo. Ah well atleast now i'm here things will be okay. I hope Amei gets better.

        <br>
        Maya hasn't been home in a while . I hate them , they left us at such a time. To fullfil their life long dreams . Well we sacrified ours to make them who they are. I hope they feel guilty now it's not how someone should behave.
